# Treasury Policy Factory Contract

The `fluxora_factory` contract is an optional wrapper around `FluxoraStream` designed specifically to enforce treasury compliance policies during stream creation.

## Overview

The base `FluxoraStream` contract is highly composable and intentionally un-opinionated about things like maximum stream sizes, minimum durations, and recipient identities. This makes it ideal as a protocol primitive. However, treasuries managing large token reserves often require strict operational policies. 

The `fluxora_factory` acts as a proxy entrypoint to enforce these policies:
- **Recipient Allowlist**: Streams can only be created for recipients explicitly allowlisted by the admin.
- **Deposit Caps**: Enforces a `MaxDepositCap` on the total `deposit_amount` of a single stream.
- **Minimum Duration**: Enforces a `MinDuration` (i.e. `end_time - start_time >= min_duration`), preventing overly short or instantaneous streams.

## Important Bypass Warning

> [!WARNING]
> Because the underlying `FluxoraStream` contract does not natively enforce these policies, **they are only enforced if the stream is created by routing through the factory contract.** 
> 
> If a user (e.g. the treasury multi-sig itself) directly calls `create_stream` on the `FluxoraStream` contract, these policies will be bypassed. To truly lock down treasury funds, the token vault or multi-sig must be configured to *only* approve transactions that invoke the `fluxora_factory` contract.

## Architecture & CEI

The factory contract follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern implicitly:
1. **Checks**: Validates the recipient against the allowlist, and bounds the deposit and duration against the configured caps.
2. **Effects**: No local persistent state changes occur during a successful stream creation.
3. **Interactions**: Makes a cross-contract call to `FluxoraStream::create_stream`.

The sender must authorize the invocation. The factory passes the sender to the stream contract, requiring the sender to also authorize the cross-contract call.

## Admin Controls

The factory has an `Admin` key managed via `set_admin`. The admin can:
- Call `set_allowlist` to grant or revoke recipient eligibility.
- Call `set_cap` to update the max deposit limit.
- Call `set_min_duration` to update the minimum duration requirement.
- Call `set_stream_contract` to upgrade or switch the underlying stream primitive if a new version is deployed.
